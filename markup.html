        <h1><em>Parallel</em> Lines</h1>
    <p>
    I’ve been tossing<br/>
    in my bed<br/>
    and all of my <strong>thoughts</strong><br/>
    are you again<br/>
    <br/>
    I’ve been <em>missing</em> you<br/>
    like <em>parallel</em> lines<br/>
    I want us to connect again<br/>
    and make a ring of <strong>permanence</strong><br/>
    Maybe then we’d be more refined<br/>
    and you would be <strong>mine</strong>.<br/>
    <p/>
