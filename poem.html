        <h1>Parallel Lines</h1>
    <p>
    I’ve been tossing<br/>
    in my bed<br/>
    and all of my thoughts<br/>
    are you again<br/>
    <br/>
    I’ve been missing you<br/>
    like parallel lines<br/>
    I want us to connect again<br/>
    and make a ring of permanence<br/>
    Maybe then we’d be more refined<br/>
    and you would be mine.<br/>
    <p/>
